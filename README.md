# YACPy
Yet Another ChessPy is the third iteration of the best chess engine on planet earth. Now with an even faster move generator based on bitmaps, an even better α-β pruning (pretty much the same as before, but without bugs), a working frontend written by the GOAT AŻ himself, and an api not written in python.
